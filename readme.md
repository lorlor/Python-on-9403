## Overview
------------
Files in this repository **Python-on-9403** are some implementations or 
solutions for questions in Online Judge of SDUT. I record these files in
order to improve my skill in solving problems. Maybe it's very simple, 
even naive, though. But I hold the view that practice makes perfect. So
I will insist. 
Good luck to everyone who will get access to this repository. 
God bless you.

## Description
Name of files in the repository follows the convention:
> ProblemTitle_ID.py
And because my working environment is Linux. So every file should start
with line like that:
> #! /usr/bin/env python
**Note**: Version of python is 2.7. I have no idea if these files can run
	successfully.

An example using python:
```python
def add(a,b):
	return a + b

for i in range(0,5):
	print add(i,i+1)
```
